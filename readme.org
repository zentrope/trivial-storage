* trivial-storage

Store a tree of values in a single file and retrieve them by key, or
by a set of keys (as a path).

** Considerations

Just an experiment!

One way to do this is to implement the various mapping interfaces so
that I could have a "disk-based" map. The reason I don't want to start
there is because:

 - Maps should be purely functional, but in this case, each "assoc" to
   a map gets written to a file. Seems a kind of violation.

 - I want to make it super clear that this thing shouldn't be used
   like a regular map because of the write-to-disk side-effect.

 - Really, this is more like a config-server or database-backed
   resource management library.
